Premake is a command line utility which reads a scripted definition of a software project and, most commonly, uses it to generate project files for toolsets like Visual Studio, Xcode, or GNU Make. Built-in and Third-Party [Modules](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Modules) add support for even more toolsets.
